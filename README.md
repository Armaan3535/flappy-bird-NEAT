# Flappy Bird Using NEAT

A Flappy Bird project trained using reinforcement learning and the NEAT algorithm.  
The bird learns to play by evolving neural networks over multiple generations without hard-coded rules.

Each bird is controlled by a neural network that receives information about its position and nearby pipes.  
Over generations, NEAT evolves better networks and improves performance automatically.

The project is implemented in Python using Pygame and NEAT-Python.  
To run the project, install the required libraries (`pygame` and `neat-python`) and execute the Python file.

The model consistently improves across generations and learns to pass multiple pipes.
